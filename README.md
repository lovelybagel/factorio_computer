Things related to my factorio computer.

I am slowly uploading videos of the computer to my youtube, I promise I am trying to improve the quality. https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCke53aLA2db2p4Fhu-RzDtQ

There is currently a blueprint of the computer, as well as some other miscellaneous components in the blueprints folder, as well as a description of the assembly language for the computer in the documentation folder.

There is an assembler for the computer in the assembler folder. You should be able to build it with gcc and make.
Currently it just prints a list of numbers which need to be manually programmed into the computer's ROM.

I will put example programs in the Programs folder as I write them.
